This is a template project for PyTorch machine learning applications in [Codeanywhere](https://codeanywhere.com/).
[Try it out](https://app.codeanywhere.com/#https://github.com/Codeanywhere-Templates/pytorch)

## Features
- Development container for PyTorch machine learning
- Pre-installed PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib
- Interactive Jupyter notebook environment
- Complete FashionMNIST classification example

## Sample Project
The template includes a complete workflow for image classification using the FashionMNIST dataset:
1. **Load and Prepare Data**: Import and normalize the FashionMNIST dataset
2. **Build a Neural Network**: Create and understand a simple but effective network to recognize clothing items
3. **Train Your Model**: Teach your network to identify different types of clothes with a training loop
4. **Test and Evaluate**: See your model in action with test images
5. **Save and Load**: Learn how to persist your trained model
